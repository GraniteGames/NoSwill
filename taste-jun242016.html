          <h4 class="heading-color-primary">The Intro</h4>
           <p>Oh <strong>MY</strong> Canada.</p>
          <p>Here at NoSwill we wanted to start with a bang, and a new-age classic bang at that. Peche Mortel is an Imperial Stout made with Espresso hailing from the great city of Montreal, Canada. This chewy, intense imperial coffee stout is a darling of beer critics, and comes in at an impressive and stylistically true 9.5% ABV. Scores of 97 on <a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1141/10325/">Beer Advocate</a> and 100 on <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/dieu-du-ciel-peche-mortel/11461/">RateBeer</a> will give you an idea of the class that this beer is in, and if you find it on a shelf somewhere at your local beer joint, you should pick it up. </p>
          <h4 class="heading-color-primary">History</h4>
           <p>Peche Mortel, or "Mortal Sin", was first concieved in October of 2001 at the Dieu de Ciel Microbrewery in Montreal, Quebec. The (then) tiny brewery infused its imperial offering with fair trade espresso during the brewing process. Called "Peche" by its fans, the stout was the first beer bottled and sold by the brewery, and crossed the border into the United States. Today, the beer can be found all over North America, though it is sometimes hard to find due to it being produced in small batches and being quite sought-after.
           
           </p>
           <h4 class="heading-color-primary">What You See:</h4>
           <p>Peche Mortel from a bottle is carbonated with CO2, and can be found on tap on Nitro, so depending on the medium, the mouthfeel and head retention will differ. Both variations are black as night, letting not even a stray ray of light through the liquid. In the bottle, the beer pours with minimal head that sticks arond for a while, and has a coloring similar to Bailey's Irish Cream. On tap, the head is like a pillow of tan-colored goodness, and tends to stick around forever. This beer is best served in a 13 oz tulip or a similar sized glass.</p>
           <h4 class="heading-color-primary">What you Smell:</h4>
           <p>Coffee, and coffee...and coffee? The Java comes through very powerfully in this brew, dominating the nose. Roasted malt is noticeable , as well as a touch of chocolate, and maybe the slightest hint of booze battling for some room in the coffee-bomb nose.</p>
           <h4 class="heading-color-primary">Tasting Notes:</h4>
           <p>The initial mouthfeel depends on the type of carbonation, but the standout flavor is.... you guessed it. Deliciously roasted Coffee. Roasted malt and Dark chocolate also dance across your tongue, and the beer is shockingly balanced despite its big flavors. On CO2, the mouthfeel is thick and satisfying, with just enough carbonation to keep it from feeling too oily. On nitrogen, it is intensely creamy and dessert-like in its richness. You will find a nice lingering bitterness at the end, as well as a warm, fuzzy feeling as the coffee-booze mixture leaves you feeling quite fine indeed.</p>
           <h4 class="heading-color-primary">Impressions/Suggestions:</h4>
           <p>A barn-burner of a beer that goes well with a dessert or a book by the fire...or pretty much any other occasion. Coffee lovers will appreciate the intense espresso flavor, and stout lovers will appreciate the robust body and lingering roasted malt that accompanies. Two or three of these bad-boys will have you feeling very buzzed, and the beer hides its booziness quite well.</p>
           <p>The creator of this beer, former Dieu de Ciel brewmaster Luc "Bim" Lafontaine, had moved on to begin his own project in the Toronto, Ontario called GodSpeed Brewery, which is slated to open up in late 2016.</p>
